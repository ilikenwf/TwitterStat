Includes emoji.json from https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data, as well as Tweetenvi and JSON.Net (NuGET).

Currently, console only, later on I may turn it into a rest service so we can properly display emoji and not just use their names.

This application displays various statistics about the twitter live sample feed.
